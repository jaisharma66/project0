                <ul>
                    <li>Computer Science is my favorite class for obvious reasons: I really enjoy programming!</li>
                    <li>I am currently taking this course</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Math</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Math has become one of my favorite classes this year becuase of my incredible teacher. He really made the class for me.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physics combines math and theory and is a very applicable subject, making it useful for me throughout my life.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>Spanish</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This class was purely made by the teacher and the students in the class. The small, focused class means that we learn a LOT more than I have before.</li>
                    <li>I am currently taking this course</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Chorus</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A creative outlet. I did chorus for 2 years before having to drop it due to schedule conflicts.</li>
                    <li>I took this course in 9th and 10th grade.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>An interesting class that goes into the details of human culture and its effect on the world.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>Theory of Knowledge</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Theory of Knowledge dives deep into how and why we learn. It is less useful, but very interesting nonetheless.</li>
                    <li>I am currently taking this course</li>
                </ul>
                <li>English</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I love the different books we read in English. The problems arise in how repetitive the class becomes after sometime.</li>
                    <li>I am currently taking this course</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Chemistry</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoyed Chemistry, but it is more memorization than I like.</li>

                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Biology is my father's favorite subject. I, on the other hand, enjoyed the class, but not the subject material as much.</li>
                    <li>I took this course in 9th grade.</li>
